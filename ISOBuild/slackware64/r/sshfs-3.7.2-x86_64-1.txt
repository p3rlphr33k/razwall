sshfs: sshfs (SSH filesystem client)
sshfs:
sshfs: This is a filesystem client based on the SSH File Transfer Protocol.
sshfs: Since most SSH servers already support this protocol it is very easy
sshfs: to set up: i.e. on the server side there's nothing to do. On the
sshfs: client side mounting the filesystem is as easy as logging into the
sshfs: server with ssh.
