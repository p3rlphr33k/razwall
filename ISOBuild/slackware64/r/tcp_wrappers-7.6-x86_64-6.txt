tcp_wrappers: With this package you can monitor and filter incoming requests for
tcp_wrappers: network services for access control, and detection things like host
tcp_wrappers: name spoofing and host address spoofing. Nearly all the network
tcp_wrappers: daemons on Slackware are "wrapped" using this library, and most
tcp_wrappers: daemons in /etc/inetd.conf use tcp_wrappers' tcpd wrapper daemon.
tcp_wrappers: If you plan to do much networking, you will need tcp_wrappers.
