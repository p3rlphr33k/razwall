gmm: gmm (C++ generic matrix template library)
gmm:
gmm: Gmm++ is a generic C++ template library for sparse, dense and skyline
gmm: matrices. It is built as a set of generic algorithms (mult, add, copy,
gmm: sub-matrices, dense and sparse solvers, etc.) for any interfaced vector 
gmm: type or matrix type. It can be viewed as a glue library that allows 
gmm: cooperation between several vector and matrix types. However, basic 
gmm: sparse, dense and skyline matrix/vector types are built in Gmm++, so 
gmm: it can be used as a standalone linear algebra library.
