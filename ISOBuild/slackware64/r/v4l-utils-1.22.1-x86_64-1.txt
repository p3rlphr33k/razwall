v4l-utils: v4l-utils (libraries and utilities for video4linux)
v4l-utils:
v4l-utils: libv4l is a collection of libraries which adds a thin abstraction
v4l-utils: layer on top of video4linux2 devices. The purpose of this (thin)
v4l-utils: layer is to make it easy for application writers to support a wide
v4l-utils: variety of devices without having to write separate code for
v4l-utils: different devices in the same class. Linux V4L2 and DVB API
v4l-utils: utilities are also included.
