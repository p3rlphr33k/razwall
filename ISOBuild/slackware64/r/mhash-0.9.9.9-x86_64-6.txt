mhash: mhash (Thread-safe hash library)
mhash:
mhash: mhash is a thread-safe hash library, implemented in C, and provides a
mhash: uniform interface to a large number of hash algorithms (MD5, SHA-1,
mhash: HAVAL, RIPEMD128, RIPEMD160, TIGER, GOST). These algorithms can be
mhash: used to compute checksums, message digests, and other signatures.
mhash: The HMAC support implements the basics for message authentication,
