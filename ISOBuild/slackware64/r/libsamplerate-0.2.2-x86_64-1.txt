libsamplerate: libsamplerate (a Sample Rate Converter for audio)
libsamplerate:
libsamplerate: Secret Rabbit Code (aka libsamplerate) is a Sample Rate Converter for
libsamplerate: audio. One example of where such a thing would be useful is
libsamplerate: converting audio from the CD sample rate of 44.1kHz to the 48kHz
libsamplerate: sample rate used by DAT players. SRC is capable of arbitrary and time
libsamplerate: varying conversions. SRC provides a small set of converters to allow
libsamplerate: quality to be traded off against computation cost.
