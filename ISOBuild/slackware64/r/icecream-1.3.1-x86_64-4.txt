icecream: icecream (distributed C/C++ compiler daemon/scheduler)
icecream:
icecream: Icecream is a distributed compile system. Icecream was created by SUSE
icecream: based on distcc. Like distcc, Icecream takes compile jobs from a build
icecream: and distributes it among remote machines allowing a parallel build.
icecream: But unlike distcc, Icecream uses a central server that dynamically
icecream: schedules the compile jobs to the fastest free server.
