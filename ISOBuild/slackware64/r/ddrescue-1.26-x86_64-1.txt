ddrescue: ddrescue (automatic data recovery tool)
ddrescue:
ddrescue: GNU ddrescue is a data recovery tool. It copies data from one file or
ddrescue: block device (hard disc, cdrom, etc) to another, trying hard to rescue
ddrescue: data in case of read errors. Every time you run it on the same output
ddrescue: file, it tries to fill in the gaps.
