libvisual-plugins: By itself, libvisual only provides a framework to build upon. The
libvisual-plugins: plugins in this package are designed to work with libvisual to allow
libvisual-plugins: it to actually do all sorts of interesting visualizations based on
libvisual-plugins: metrics gathered as players process audio information data. Plugins
libvisual-plugins: can be mixed (more than one run at a time), or morphed from one to
libvisual-plugins: another. Other special effects are possible as well.
