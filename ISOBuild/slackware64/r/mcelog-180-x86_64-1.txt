mcelog: mcelog (Machine Check Event logger)
mcelog:
mcelog: mcelog is the user space backend for logging machine check errors
mcelog: reported by the hardware to the kernel. The kernel does the immediate
mcelog: actions (like killing processes etc.) and mcelog decodes the logs the
mcelog: errors. It primarily handles machine checks and thermal events, which
mcelog: are reported for errors detected by the CPU. It is recommended that
mcelog: mcelog runs on all x86 machines, both 64-bit and 32bit.
