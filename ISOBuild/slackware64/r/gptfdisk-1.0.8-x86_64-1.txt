gptfdisk:
gptfdisk: GPT fdisk (consisting of the gdisk, cgdisk, sgdisk, and fixparts
gptfdisk: programs) is a set of text-mode partitioning tools for using a GPT
gptfdisk: (GUID Partition Table), rather than the traditional MBR (Master Boot
gptfdisk: Record) partition tables. It features several partitioning tools,
gptfdisk: recovery tools to help you deal with corrupt partition tables, and the
gptfdisk: ability to convert MBR disks to GPT format.
