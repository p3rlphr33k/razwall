dash: dash (fast and small POSIX-compliant /bin/sh)
dash:
dash: DASH is a POSIX-compliant implementation of /bin/sh that aims to be
dash: as small as possible. It does this without sacrificing speed. In fact,
dash: it is significantly faster than bash (the GNU Bourne-Again SHell) for
dash: most tasks. DASH is a direct descendant of the NetBSD version of ash
dash: (Kenneth Almquist's Almquist shell), ported to Linux by Herbert Xu.
