xxHash: xxHash (Extremely fast Hash algorithm)
xxHash:
xxHash: xxHash is an Extremely fast Hash algorithm, running at RAM speed
xxHash: limits. It successfully completes the [SMHasher]
xxHash: (https://code.google.com/p/smhasher/wiki/SMHasher) test suite which
xxHash: evaluates collision, dispersion and randomness qualities of hash
xxHash: functions. Code is highly portable, and hashes are identical on all
xxHash: platforms (little / big endian).
