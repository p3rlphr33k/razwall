brotli: brotli (Brotli compression format)
brotli:
brotli: Brotli is a general purpose lossless compression algorithm that
brotli: compresses data using a combination of a modern variant of the LZ77
brotli: algorithm, Huffman coding, and second order context modeling, with a
brotli: compression ratio comparable to the best currently available general
brotli: purpose compression methods. It is similar in speed with deflate but
brotli: offers more dense compression.
