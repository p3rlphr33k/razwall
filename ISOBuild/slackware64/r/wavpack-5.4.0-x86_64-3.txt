wavpack:
wavpack: WavPack is a completely open audio compression format providing
wavpack: lossless, high-quality lossy, and a unique hybrid compression mode.
wavpack: The hybrid mode creates both a relatively small, high-quality lossy
wavpack: file that can be used all by itself, and a "correction" file that
wavpack: (when combined with the lossy file) provides full lossless
wavpack: restoration.
