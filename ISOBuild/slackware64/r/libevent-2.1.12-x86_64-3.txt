libevent: libevent (event loop library)
libevent:
libevent: libevent is meant to replace the event loop found in event driven
libevent: network servers. An application just needs to call event_dispatch()
libevent: and then add or remove events dynamically without having to change the
libevent: event loop. The libevent API provides a mechanism to execute a
libevent: callback function when a specific event occurs on a file descriptor or
libevent: after a timeout has been reached.
