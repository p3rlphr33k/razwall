inih: inih (INI Not Invented Here)
inih:
inih: inih (INI Not Invented Here)** is a simple .INI file parser written in
inih: C. It's only a couple of pages of code, and it was designed to be
inih: small and simple, so it's good for embedded systems. It's also more or
inih: less compatible with Python's ConfigParser style of .INI files,
inih: including RFC 822-style multi-line syntax and `name: value` entries.
