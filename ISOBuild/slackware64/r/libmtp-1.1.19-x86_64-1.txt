libmtp: libmtp (A library for MTP media devices)
libmtp:
libmtp: libmtp is a library that attempts to support Microsoft's Media
libmtp: Transfer Protocol (MTP). It was initially based on the great libptp2
libmtp: library by Mariusz Woloszyn now maintained by Marcus Meissners, and
libmtp: Hubert Figuere's libgphoto2 work based on libptp2 (or is libptp2
libmtp: based on libgphoto?). It is like a master DJ has remixed all of
libmtp: these tracks and then added a new API adapted for portable media
libmtp: players. :-)
