lvm2: Heinz Mauelshagen's LVM (Logical Volume Manager) for Linux.
lvm2: LVM adds an additional layer between the physical peripherals and the
lvm2: low-level I/O interface to get a logical view of disks. This allows
lvm2: the concatenation of several disks (so-called physical volumes or PVs)
lvm2: to form a storage pool (so-called Volume Group or VG) with allocation
lvm2: units called physical extents (called PE). With LVM, you can extend,
lvm2: resize, or relocate storage dynamically.
