subversion: subversion (a version control system)
subversion:
subversion: Subversion is a version control system which allows you to keep old
subversion: versions of files and directories (usually source code), and keep a
subversion: log of who, when, and why changes occurred, similar to other such
subversion: systems like CVS, RCS or SCCS. Subversion keeps all the information
subversion: to permit extracting previous versions of those files at any time.
