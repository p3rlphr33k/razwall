netwrite: netwrite (in.writed daemon for accepting network "write")
netwrite:
netwrite: Writed implements a very simple protocol that allows a write(1)
netwrite: program on one host to connect up to one on another host, allowing
netwrite: communications across the network. Writed is meant to be run from
netwrite: inetd(8) listening for TCP requests on port 811. No attempt is made
netwrite: to determine the authenticity of users sending messages. This
netwrite: program should probably not be deployed on insecure networks.
