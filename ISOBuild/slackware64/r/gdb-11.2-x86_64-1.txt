gdb: gdb (the GNU symbolic debugger)
gdb: GDB, the GNU Project debugger, allows you to see what is going on 
gdb: inside another program while it executes - or what another program
gdb: was doing at the moment it crashed. GDB can do four main kinds of
gdb: things to help you catch bugs in the act: 1) Start your program,
gdb: specifying anything that might affect its behavior. 2) Make your
gdb: program stop on specified conditions. 3) Examine what has happened,
gdb: when your program has stopped. 4) Change things in your program, so
gdb: you can experiment with correcting the effects of one bug and go on
gdb: to learn about another. The program being debugged can be written in
gdb: Ada, C, C++, Objective-C, Pascal and many other languages.
