libseccomp: libseccomp (enhanced seccomp library)
libseccomp:
libseccomp: The libseccomp library provides an easy to use, platform independent,
libseccomp: interface to the Linux Kernel's syscall filtering mechanism. The
libseccomp: libseccomp API is designed to abstract away the underlying BPF based
libseccomp: syscall filter language and present a more conventional function-call
libseccomp: based filtering interface that should be familiar to, and easily
libseccomp: adopted by, application developers.
