liboil: liboil (a library of simple functions)
liboil:
liboil: Liboil is a library of simple functions that are optimized for 
liboil: various CPUs. These functions are generally loops implementing 
liboil: simple algorithms, such as converting an array of N integers to 
liboil: floating-point numbers or multiplying and summing an array of N 
liboil: numbers. Such functions are candidates for significant optimization 
liboil: using various techniques, especially by using extended instructions 
liboil: provided by modern CPUs (Altivec, MMX, SSE, etc.).
