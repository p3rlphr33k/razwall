python-setuptools_scm: python-setuptools_scm (manages versions in SCM metadata)
python-setuptools_scm:
python-setuptools_scm: setuptools_scm handles managing your Python package versions in SCM
python-setuptools_scm: metadata instead of declaring them as the version argument or in a SCM
python-setuptools_scm: managed file. It also provides setuptools with a list of files that
python-setuptools_scm: are managed by the SCM. Git and mercurial are supported out of the
python-setuptools_scm: box.
