nvi: nvi (ex/vi text editor)
nvi:
nvi: Nvi is an implementation of the ex/vi text editor. Nvi supports all
nvi: the historic ex/vi features except for open mode and the lisp edit
nvi: option (it has a fully implemented underlying ex mode). Some
nvi: additional features are: extended regular expressions, infinite undo,
nvi: UTF8 support, and multiple edit buffers. Nvi has a very small memory
nvi: footprint.
