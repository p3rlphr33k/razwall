# Put in this directory (endian/data/hooks) the modules implementing datasource hooks
#
# Example:
# The following is the content of time.py. This module exposes the hook "TIME.NOW"
#
#  import datetime
#  from endian.data.hooks import hook
#
#  @hook
#  def now():
#      return datetime.datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
#
# You can execute the hook using: DataSource().time.now
