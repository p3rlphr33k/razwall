    This is a masked input fiedl based on a jQuery's plugin.
    It allows a user to more easily enter fixed width input where you would like them
    to enter the data in a certain format.
    
    A mask is defined by a format made up of mask literals and mask definitions.
    Any character not in the definitions list below is considered a mask literal.
    Mask literals will be automatically entered for the user as they type and will
    not be able to be removed by the user.The following mask definitions are predefined:

    * a - Represents an alpha character (A-Z,a-z)
    * 9 - Represents a numeric character (0-9)
    * * - Represents an alphanumeric character (A-Z,a-z,0-9)
